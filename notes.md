### Definitions
Context - 
Focus - 
Consciousness - 
Sensory Input - 
Intuition - black box, selects current context. May lead to "aha" moments or simply 

## Challenges

Determine training/validation and problem to apply to

## Notes

Why only 3 systems?
Further, it appears we can only go one level "up" - a person has the ability to think about themselves, but they cannot think about themselves thinking, therefore, there appears again to be two two primary "systems" at work - the data "filter", or "pattern recognizer" and the analytical agent.


Apply to:
	maze navigation?
	NLP?
	"Hand" counting to N in sequence?
	Each ANN is digit classifier: get agent to spell a word - on success, no store state -genetic alg does work each time.
	Pick out patterns across each input from noise?
	Give two forms of an equation and determine which is "better"
	Each ann is a mode of operation
	Agent decides some binary conceptual comparison-based decision
IDEA: intution vs analytical system - genetic alg decides allocation between two systems.
IDEA: threading process allocation - genetic alg determines optimal allocation
IDEA: we can only focus on one context at a time, but how do we weight each one?
How are the inputs weighted? Biased by "amount" of input and log(type)? I.e. Fire vs. TV - Fire is big and new.
Context - an amalgamation of input from the five-senses input - we listen and see at the same time?
